# âš™ Dashboard

The dashboard is the core of being able to create application forms.

In order to create good application forms, it is important that you understand and can navigate in Appy's dashboard. The next few pages will step-to-step guide you through the dashboard, so you will be able to use it while you sleep.

## Logging in

When you invite Appy bot to your server, a dashboard will automatically be created for that server. This makes it easier when you have to use it for the first time.

To log in to the dashboard, click the link below:&#x20;
