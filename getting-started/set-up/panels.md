# üëç Panels

You have now made an application form and would like to post it so that is displayed for your members.

## What is a Panel?&#x20;

With a Panel you can show which open application forms you have, this provides an easier overview for your members.\
You can have several application forms under one Panel or you can choose to only one. A panel is an easy way for you to display all the application forms that members can access. It is easy to get an overview if for example, you have several application forms open at the same time.
