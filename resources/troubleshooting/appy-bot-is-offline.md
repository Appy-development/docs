# üëç Appy bot is offline

## Appy is not responding?

There can be several reasons why Appy is offline. It could be that the serves has gone down, we are restarting the server or there is maintenance on the server.

## How to fix?

First make sure the bot is online or offline.&#x20;

If the bot icon have a <mark style="color:green;">green dot</mark> the Appy Bot is online and everyone is good.&#x20;

If the bot icon is grey, the Appy bot is offline. Head to our [**Support Server**](https://discord.com/invite/bDmc55c6zY) and check the last messages in **#announcements** and **#bot-status**
