# 👍 Appy is not posting

You have made an application form and pressed save, but it does not appear on your discord. There could be several reasons for this.

## How to fix?

* You need to make a [Panel](../../getting-started/set-up/panels.md)
* [Appy is offline](appy-bot-is-offline.md)

{% hint style="success" %}
Your applicantion form is active and your members can still apply through the [commands](../commands.md) `/apply <application_name>`
{% endhint %}
