## Why is Appy sending this?

If you have a closed DM, then Appy cannot send you the application form and an error will therefore occur.

## How to fix it?

There are a couple of different settings which can cause this problem.

First of all, make sure you have not blocked Appy bot. If you have blocked it, unblock it and try again. If you are still having issues, read below:

1. Go to your Discord client settings
2. Click on Privacy and Safety
3. Turn on the "Allow direct messages from server members"&#x20;

If you are still having issues after this, go to the server which appy cannot dm you in and right click the server profile picture in your server navigation bar. You will see a "privacy settings" button, click this.

Once done, you will then see a popup, make sure the "Direct messages" option is enabled&#x20;
