## Why is Appy sending this?

If you have a closed DM, then Appy cannot send you the application form and an error will therefore occur.

## How to fix it?

There is something wrong with your discord settings, follow this to open up for DM's.&#x20;

1. Go to your User Settings
2. Click on Privacy and Safety
3. Turn on the "Allow direct messages from server members"&#x20;
