## Application was to large?

Sometimes you will find that an application was to large to be displayed in an embed. \
Click the link to Appys dashboard where you can see the application on the dashboard.&#x20;

## Why is applications to large?&#x20;

* If length of entire embed is over 6000 characters.

## Why cant my staff not see the large applications?

Not everyone has access to the dashboard and in this way can see the long applications.

How to fix it:&#x20;

* Assign the roles that need to see the applications permission to "Manage Server" at the server settings.&#x20;
* Or use the premium feature: <mark style="color:yellow;">Application manager roles.</mark>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Giving permission to "Manage Server" can be dangerous, as your users who have this permission will be able to: _`Allow members to change this server's name, switch region, view all invites, add bots to this server and create and update AutoMod rules.`_
